Roadmap
-------

    - Styling
    - Author page
    - Translator page
    - More natural URLs?  E.g. `/books/lao-tzu/tao-te-ching/derek-lin`.
      Might also be good for DB in sense of avoiding surrogate keys.  Probably
      be better for SEO.
    - Better UI for comparing/switching translations
    - User account.
    - Personal book.  You can save verses from other books to your personal
      book.
    - Custom verses.
    - Random verse.
    - Feature to email you mantras periodically.
    - Recommend verse/book/author based on authors/books you like and what
      similar people like.
